Hi Lloyd,
 
Here is a link to download Blink + SDK with an extra-long timeout: https://meadowlark.sharefile.com/d-s4a12b0e994f46079
 
I made the change and recompiled from the latest version for you. There have been a couple minor bug fixes since the previous version. Iâ€™d recommend upgrading only if you are experiencing any issues.
 
Here is also a document explaining the output pulse: https://meadowlark.sharefile.com/d-s21c7d03d4de4067a
 
It is enabled by the Use_external_pulse in the Preferences.ini file or the External_pulse parameter in the SDK.
 
Regards,
Dane Elshof
